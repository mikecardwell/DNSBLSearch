DNSBLSearch is a simple Perl script for performing large numbers of RBL lookups
very quickly. It's useful if you have a set of IP addresses of mail servers and
you want to be automatically alerted if any of them become listed on an RBL.

The script comes with a default list of IP addresses and popular RBLs. If you
run it before making any changes it should display an output similar to this:
                
	127.0.0.2 is listed on blackholes.five-ten-sg.com
	127.0.0.2 is listed on spamsources.fabel.dk
	127.0.0.2 is listed on combined.njabl.org
	127.0.0.2 is listed on bl.spamcop.net
	127.0.0.2 is listed on dnsbl.sorbs.net
	127.0.0.2 is listed on zen.spamhaus.org
                
127.0.0.2 is one of the example IP addresses to look up, and most RBLs list
127.0.0.2 for testing purposes. You would change that IP in the script for
your own.

The script should work on any default Perl installation as it uses no
non-standard Perl packages.
